# Path Solver
A simple game starter that includes basic operations such as:
- Entry screen with interactive buttons
- A layout with source and destination areas
- Randomized draggable obstacles
- A vehicle sprite which travels at a constant speed along its forward direction
- The vehicle turns to navigate to the clicked position while avoiding all obstacles
